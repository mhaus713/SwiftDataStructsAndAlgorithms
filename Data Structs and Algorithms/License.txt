Hello!

My name is Michael Hollingshaus and I am a computer science student attempting to further my knowledge fundamental data structures and algorithms in my free time.

I have created this library with the intent of using it in personal projects, but if you would like to access it, you are more than welcome to, so long as you give proper credit where it is due. I won't be super picky as to how you choose to do so, but would appreciate it.

This code is by no means complete or amazing, as I am still doing my best to learn, and any feedback is appreciated in how to make this codebase better.

You are free to modify, use, abuse, modify, break, love, cherish, badmouth, etc. this code. It is intended for legal and honest purposes, and I hold no responsibility for any legal troubles that may arise should you choose to use these files.
